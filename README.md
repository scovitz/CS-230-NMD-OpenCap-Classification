This code has been tested on MacOS.

## Code Installation

1. Install the [(mini)conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/mamba-installation.html) Python environment manager.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to an empty working directory where you will download the code and data. Clone the GitHub repository and enter it:

3. Initialize the conda environment for the repository and install all necessary dependencies:

```
cd [path_to_empty_working_directory]
git clone https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/opencap-fshd-dm-analysis.git
cd opencap-fshd-dm-analysis
conda env create -f environment.yml -n opensim-nmd
conda activate opensim-nmd
conda install -c bioconda snakemake
conda install -c opensim-org opensim=4.4
cd ..
```


## Data Access

To access the dataset, go to https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13788592 and press "Download All"

Unzip the downloaded file and rename the unzipped folder to `datadir`.

Move the `datadir` directory to be contained inside the same parent directory as the code repository `opencap-fshd-dm-analysis`.

At this point, your working directory should be organized as follows:

```
[working_directory]
├── datadir
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── feature_key.csv
│   ├── opencap_data.zip
│   ├── opencap_markers.png
│   ├── participant_info.csv
│   └── video_features.csv
└── opencap-fshd-dm-analysis
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── README.md
    ├── environment.yml
    ├── feature_extraction
    └── figure_generation
```

Unzip the `opencap_data .zip` directory.

```
unzip datadir/opencap_data.zip -d datadir
```

## Feature Extraction

The feature extraction pipeline uses the [snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/). This is a Makefile-like tool that automates feature extraction across all of the activities. This may take 10 minutes to run or more depending on your machine. Use the lines below to run the pipeline. At any time, the pipeline can be halted by pressing `CTL-C`. When restarted, it snakemake will resume from where it left off.

```
cd opencap-fshd-dm-analysis/feature_extraction
snakemake -c1
```

To parallelize over n cores use `-c[n]` (e.g. `-c4` parallelizes over 4 cores).

To reduce the verbosity of the terminal output,  add the `--quiet` flag.

## Figure Generation

The code for figure generation code is in Jupyter notebooks. Use these commands to launch Jupyter Lab.

```
cd ../figure_generation
jupyter lab
```
At this point, you will be able to select individual notebooks and run all cells to generate our figures. 

Intraclass correlation is calculated in `fig3_icc.ipynb` by calling an R script from Python via a shell. On MacOS, the `Rscript` command can be acquired by installing [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/). If R is not available on the computer, an alternative is to run the `fig3_icc_no_Rscript.ipynb` file, which reads all of the ICC from a pre-computed CSV file.
